I'm planning a trip to visit the Colosseum in Rome next month and could use some help putting things together. I'd love to learn a bit about the history first, like when was it built and what was it originally used for? I'm also looking for restaurant recommendations, maybe 3 highly-rated places within 1km that serve traditional Italian food. For getting there, I'm staying at a hotel near Termini Station so I'm wondering how long it would take to walk to the Colosseum and what's the best route. I have some mobility concerns so I'm also curious about the terrain and whether the area around the Colosseum is hilly at all. Oh, and my Italian is pretty rusty so could you translate a couple of phrases for me? I'll need "Where can I buy tickets?" and "How much does it cost?" in Italian.
